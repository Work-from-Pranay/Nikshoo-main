      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Cleaning:</strong> Dust your furniture regularly with a soft

          <strong>Avoid Direct Sunlight:</strong> Keep furniture away from direct

          <strong>Use Coasters:</strong> Protect surfaces from water rings and stains 
          by using coasters under drinks and hot items.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condition Leather:</strong> If you have leather furniture, use a 
          leather conditioner to keep it supple and prevent cracking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rotate Cushions:</strong> Rotate and fluff cushions regularly to
